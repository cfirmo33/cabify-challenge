# Cabify Code Challenge

In this repository you will find some code in response to the Cabify
Code Challenge.
 
* An [implementation using Ruby](ruby/). This is the classical
approach using OOP through Duck Typing in a dynamically typed language.

* An [implementation using Go](go/). Using structural typing
implemented with Go interfaces and some thread-safety using goroutines
and channels.

* An [implementation using Scala](scala/). Using OOP mixed
with an actor model to provide thread-safety.

* An [implementation using Rust](rust/). Using typeclasses as interpreted
by Rust and using again a MPSC channel communication provide thread-safety.
